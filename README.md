# Binary search algorithm

This repository contains two implementations of the binary search algorithm:
1. Recursive Binary Search
2. Iterative Binary Search

## How it works
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target value in a sorted list. The algorithm repeatedly divides the search space into halves until the target value is found or the search space becomes empty.

### Key Features
- **Time complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space complexity:**
  - Iterative: O(1)
  - Recursive: O(log n) (due to recursive call stack)

## Files
- recursive.py - contains the recursive implementation.
- iterative.py - contains the iterative implementation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GabyAbraxas/Binary_search.git
